# React Native Basics: Components, Props, and State

## Getting Started

Before we dive into components, props, and state, we need to set up our development environment. We'll create a new React Native project using Expo, which provides a set of tools and services for React Native development.

## Project Setup Explained

Let's break down each step of our setup process:

1. **Create a new Expo project**:
   - We'll use `npx create-expo-app` which creates a new React Native project with Expo
   - `basic-resume` will be our project name
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app basic-resume
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   - Change into the newly created project folder
   ```bash
   cd basic-resume
   ```

3. **Set up a proper project structure**:
   - Create a `src` folder to organize our source code
   - Create a `components` folder inside `src` to store our React components
   - This structure helps keep our code organized as the project grows
   ```bash
   mkdir src
   mkdir src/components
   ```

After running these commands, your project structure will look like this:
```
basic-resume/
├── src/
│   └── components/    # Where we'll store our components
├── App.js            # Main application file
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
└── ... other files   # Various configuration files
```

## Part 1: Understanding Components

### What is a Component?
In React Native, a component is like a building block for your app's interface. Think of it like a custom LEGO piece that you can:
- Create once and reuse many times
- Customize with different data
- Combine with other components to build complex interfaces

Components can be as simple as a button or as complex as an entire screen. They help us:
- Break down our app into manageable pieces
- Reuse code instead of repeating it
- Keep our code organized and maintainable

### Creating Our First Component

We'll start by creating a simple Header component. This component will display a name and title, showing us the basic structure of a React Native component.

1. **Create a new file**:
   - Create `Header.js` in the components folder
   - Path should be: `src/components/Header.js`

2. **Understanding the Component Structure**:
   - Components are JavaScript functions that return JSX
   - They must import necessary items from 'react-native'
   - This component uses the `View` and the `Text` components.
   - `View` is the equivalent of a `div` and `Text` is the equivalent of a `p`
   - They must return a single parent element
   - They should be exported to use in other files

Here's our first component:
```javascript
// src/components/Header.js
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

// This is a basic component that displays text
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>John Doe</Text>
      <Text>Software Developer</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Header;
```
Using Our Header Component

Now that we've created our Header component, let's use it in our app. To do this, we need to:
1. Import the Header component into App.js
2. Add it to our app's JSX

Here's how we update our App.js:

```javascript
// App.js
import { View } from 'react-native';
// Import our Header component
import Header from './src/components/Header';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      {/* Use our Header component */}
      <Header />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Let's break down what's happening in App.js:
1. We import `View` from react-native (just like in our Header)
2. We import our Header component using a relative path
   - './src' means "start from the current folder and go into src"
   - '/components' means "then go into the components folder"
   - '/Header' refers to our Header.js file
3. We use our Header component like an HTML tag: `<Header />`
4. Just like our Header, App.js needs a single parent element (`View`)

When you run your app now (using `npm start` or `expo start`), you should see:
- John Doe
- Software Developer

This text comes from our Header component!

## Part 2: Understanding and Using Props

### What are Props?
Props (short for "properties") are how we pass data to components. They work like:
- Parameters in a function
- Attributes in an HTML tag
- Configuration settings for a component

Think of props as a way to customize a component each time you use it. Just like how you might configure settings on your phone, props let you configure how a component looks and behaves.

### Why Do We Need Props?
Without props, components would be static and show the same thing every time. Props allow us:
- To reuse components with different data
- To make components flexible and customizable
- To pass data from parent components to child components

### Making Our Header Dynamic with Props

Now that we have our Header component displaying in our app, let's make it dynamic using props. Currently, our Header shows the same hardcoded text every time. Let's modify our App.js to pass different text to our Header component:

```javascript
// App.js
import { View } from 'react-native';
import Header from './src/components/Header';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      {/* Pass props to our Header component */}
      <Header 
        name="Sarah Wilson" 
        title="React Native Developer" 
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Let's update our Header component to accept and use these props. In `src/components/Header.js`:

```javascript
// src/components/Header.js
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

// Props are passed as a parameter to the component
const Header = (props) => {
  // We can destructure props to get specific values
  const { name, title } = props;
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{name}</Text>
      <Text>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

Let's break down what's happening:
1. In App.js, we add properties to our Header component:
   - `name="Sarah Wilson"` passes a name prop
   - `title="React Native Developer"` passes a title prop
2. In Header.js:
   - The component receives props as a parameter
   - We destructure `name` and `title` from props
   - We use these values inside our Text components with curly braces: `{name}`

When you run the app now, you should see:
- Sarah Wilson
- React Native Developer

These values are coming from the props we passed in App.js!

## Part 3: Building a Simple Resume

### 1. Create a Contact Component
```javascript
// src/components/Contact.js
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const Contact = ({ email, phone }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Email: {email}</Text>
      <Text>Phone: {phone}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Contact;
```

### 2. Create an Experience Component
```javascript
// src/components/Experience.js
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const Experience = ({ company, position, years }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{company}</Text>
      <Text>{position}</Text>
      <Text>{years}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Experience;
```

### 3. Put it All Together in App.js
```javascript
// App.js
import { View } from 'react-native';
import Header from './src/components/Header';
import Contact from './src/components/Contact';
import Experience from './src/components/Experience';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Header 
        name="John Doe" 
        title="Software Developer" 
      />
      
      <Contact 
        email="john@email.com"
        phone="123-456-7890"
      />
      
      <Experience 
        company="Tech Corp"
        position="Senior Developer"
        years="2020-2023"
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Part 4: Basic Styling

React Native uses JavaScript objects for styling. StyleSheet.create() helps optimize styles and provides better error checking. Lets add some styling to our header.

```javascript
// Example with styles
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const Header = ({ name, title }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.name}>{name}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

// StyleSheet.create makes styles more efficient
// It's like creating a stylesheet in CSS
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,          // Adds space inside the container
    marginTop: 40,        // Adds space above the container
  },
  name: {
    fontSize: 24,         // Sets text size
    fontWeight: 'bold',   // Makes text bold
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 18,         // Smaller text size
    color: '#666',        // Gray text color
  },
});

export default Header;
```

Add some styling to the Experience and Contact components.

## Part 5: Understanding State

State is for data that changes over time in a component. Unlike props (which are passed from parent), state is managed inside a component.

### Creating a Counter Component
```javascript
// src/components/Counter.js
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
// Import useState hook from React
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // useState returns:
  // 1. The current state value (count)
  // 2. A function to update it (setCount)
  // useState(0) sets initial value to 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      
      {/* When button is pressed, update state */}
      <Button 
        title="Increase" 
        onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} 
      />
      
      <Button 
        title="Decrease" 
        onPress={() => setCount(count - 1)} 
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

Add Counter to App.js:
```javascript
// App.js
// ... other imports
import Counter from './src/components/Counter';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... other components */}
      <Counter />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Understanding useState

1. What is useState?
   - A Hook that lets you add state to functional components
   - Returns an array with two items: current state and update function
   - The update function triggers a re-render when called

2. Why use useState?
   - To handle data that changes over time
   - To make components interactive
   - To update the UI when data changes

3. useState Rules:
   - Can only be called inside components
   - Must be called at the top level (not in loops or conditions)
   - Initial value is only used on first render

Example with multiple states:
```javascript
const Counter = () => {
  // You can have multiple state variables
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Text>Step Size: {step}</Text>
      <Button 
        title="Increase" 
        onPress={() => setCount(count + step)} 
      />
      <Button 
        title="Change Step"
        onPress={() => setStep(step + 1)}
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Add a Skills component that takes an array of skills as props
2. Add a reset button to the Counter component


## Key Takeaways

1. Components are reusable UI pieces
2. Props pass data down from parent to child
3. State manages data that changes within a component
4. useState is the hook for managing state in functional components
